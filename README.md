## Usage

To start using Flurben's Fantastic Foods, simply plant the new crops and follow the recipes provided in EMI. Use KubeJS to create custom recipes and tweak the mod to fit your playstyle.

Currently EMI will not show the recipe for the raw hot dog buns, as they are using Terrafirmacraft's knapping system.
The recipes are accessed by right-clicking with Flurben's Fantastic Foods' raw dough item and making the following pattern, where X is the pieces leftover and the spaces are where you must remove the tiles from the 5x5 grid.
